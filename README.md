# api
My code and dataset for blog post 2

code.ipynb includes all of the code I used to connect to the API, make a dataframe from the scraped information, and write the dataframe out to a csv file

NCAAbasketball.csv is my dataframe of men's college basketball teams. It includes team names, mascots, abbreviations, records, and what conference the team is in. To simplify the dataset, I only included teams that are in specific conferences, ommitting the rest.
