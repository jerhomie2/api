# api
My code and dataset for blog post 2

code.ipynb includes all of the code I used to connect to the API, make a dataframe from the scraped information, write the dataframe out to a csv file, and extract summaries and statistics from the data.

NCAAbasketball.csv is my dataframe of men's college basketball teams. It includes team names, mascots, abbreviations, records, and what conference the team is in. To simplify the dataset, I only included teams that are in a conference.
